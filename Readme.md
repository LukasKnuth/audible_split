# Audbile Split

Takes a single Audbile `.aax`-file and splits it into one `.mp3`-file per chapter.

**Requirement** This tool uses the `ffprobe` and `ffmpeg` CLI utilities. These must either be in the same directory as the tool or in the `PATH`.

## CLI

Run `audbile_split --help` to see all available parameters.

The only required parameters are `--input` the specify the Adudible file and `--activation_bytes` to encrypt it.

## About AAX files

The `.aax` file-format is the format used by Audible for it's AudioBooks. It's basically an AAC audio stream with an encryption header and probably a watermark.

The Audio-stream has Stereo at 64 kbit/s (1 hour audio = 25 MB). Therfore, the quality is already pretty low, which should still be fine for spoken language. The default quality-setting reflects this low input quality and creates files which about match the original file-size while preserving the quality.

However, the output quality can be adjusted with the `--quality` argument. See the programs help for more information.

## Encryption and Activation Bytes

To decrypt an `.aax` file, it's Activation Bytes are required. These will be the same accross all files downloaded from a single Audible account, so you'll only need to run these steps once.

1. Download an Audiobook `.aax` file from Audible and copy it to a work-directory.

    These can be accessed directly from the Audible site from the Download button on the "My Books" page (under "Library"), <https://www.audible.com.au/lib>

    Alternatively, they can be downloaded via the Audible app and the `.aax` file extracted from their application directory:

    * On Windows 10, get the Audbile App from the Microsoft Store and download an AudioBook. The files are located under `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Packages\AudibleInc.AudibleforWindowsPhone_xns73kv1ymhp2\LocalState\Content`
    * On Linux: ? (PR accepted!)
    * On MacOSX: ? (PR accepted!)
2. Clone or download https://github.com/inAudible-NG/tables
3. Run `ffprobe <file>.aax` and find `file checksum == 999a6ab8...` in the output.
4. Run `tables/run/rcrack tables/ -h <checksum>` and find `result --- hex: CA8...` in the output
5. The 8-character hexadecimal string are the Activation Bytes. These must be supplied to the tool.
6. Run the tool: `audible_split -a <activation_bytes> -i <file>.aax`
